# Governor DAO Proof of Existence Use cases

Governor DAO Proof of Existence Use cases

The following are a few common test cases where GDAO Proof of Existence solution addresses key issues fighting against sybil attacks.

**Use Case 1: Non Verified Wallet Whitelist**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

When projects or artists plan a presale for either a token or NFT launch there may be an offer of a whitelist. The whitelist wallet discovery would typically be in the format of a Google form which would potentially gather information including Telegram, Discord and an email address, all attributes which are not verified. Due to the anonymous unverified nature of the data the confidence of a fair launch is lost. A ‘fair launch’ would be flattening the landscape to ensure each person has the same opportunity as the next to acquire the token or asset through the sales platform. Traditionally a person connecting their wallet to the dApp and executing a purchase without using a bot, script, or any other method to frontrun a launch. The other key element also is confidence only one wallet per person can be verified to fight for sybil resistance. One of the biggest challenges in blockchain are the misuse of multiple wallets per person to gain an unfair advantage over the volume of assets which may be available in a launch. A person owning 10/20 wallets which could be used to participate in a whitelist sale to acquire a larger stake in the circulating supply wouldn’t be uncommon. If an NFT sale reserved 500 NFT’s for presale at a discount price, one person could consume the majority through a bot or script which would leave very few for genuine whitelisters who were looking to purchase one or two.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Enroll on the Proof of Existence Portal to gain a PoE token. Developers can add a check into their dApp to check for the ERC20 PoE token for any whitelisting.

**Use Case 2: Effective anon ban system**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

As per any whitelist strategy is the flip side of a confident introduction of blacklist. Bad actors across blockchain are out of control and constantly on the increase which contribute to a number of negative experiences which we all inherit the fallout in some capacity. Defending against these attacks is a challenge but a simple prevention on known bad actor wallets would be to simply add to the blacklist.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Blacklisted wallet addresses can be added to the PoE Contract. Developers and projects can configure their dApp to check for PoE ERC20 token and blacklisted wallets from same PoE Contract.

**Use Case 3: Provably fair token launches/NFT mints**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

A ‘Provably fair launch’ would be flattening the landscape to ensure each person has the same opportunity as the next to acquire the token or asset through the sales platform. Traditionally a person connecting their wallet to the dApp in preparation for an upcoming launch and executing a purchase without using a bot, script, or any other method to frontrun a launch. One of the biggest challenges in blockchain are the misuse of multiple wallets per person & bots to gain an unfair advantage over the volume of assets which may be available in an NFT or token launch. If an NFT sale reserved 500 NFT’s for presale at a discount price, one person could consume the majority through a bot or script which would leave very few for participants who were looking to purchase a small number of tokens or a couple of NFT’s. These sybil attacks result in a very high negative user experience with confidence tainted with the project due to the misadventure.

**Mitigation Strategy**

GDAO can provide Governance As A Service (GAAS) to launch an upcoming NFT or Token launch. Proof of Existence Launch pad is operational which has a number of validations based on the conditions of the NFT artist which includes validation on a PoE VIP whitelist. An liquid generation event (LGE) can also be hosted by GDAO to provide an array of options and offerings based on ownership of a PoE token as part of pre and public sales.

**Use Case 4: Airdrops**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

When a project coordinates an airdrop, the aim would be a fair distribution of tokens to a person/wallet but unfortunately an airdrop would typically result in tokens either sent or claimed on multiple wallets. When a person claims multiple times across wallets this provides an unfair distribution potentially resulting in genuine persons with one wallet missing out. There may be an airdrop of 100,000, 1,000 per wallet with one person owning 20 wallets and consuming 20% of the total airdrop.\
An additional challenge would be calculating a practical sized airdrop based on enrolled wallets. In order to have a level of confidence that all participants received a fair distribution the calculation would typically be based on the number of wallets. Obviously, this method would not provide a confident distribution per person without a large percentage being sent to multiple wallets owned by one person.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Allocating airdrops for all wallets which have been registered through the Proof of Existence Portal will provide the provably fair allocation of tokens to one wallet per person.

**Use Case 5: Democratic voting, rep-based, capped-per-person**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

Typical project voting is coordinated via a weighted vote therefore any large token holders or large token holders with multiple wallets would dominate the majority of votes they choose to take part in. This type of dominance results in whales and holders of multiple wallets directing the project in their biased direction based on their weighted token holdings. Small token holders would have very little impact on any project direction based on a voting system of this nature.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Incorporating the PoE ERC20 token into to [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) provides a confident landscape that the primary voting criteria is one person / one wallet. Additional criteria can be used as a primary requirement for example having x amount of the project token as well as a PoE token.

**Use Case 6: Bots**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

In a high percentage of NFT & token sales bots secure the majority with a few minutes of the launch. This type of behaviour usually results in a spike in gas charges due to the bots attempting to frontrun the launch pushing up gas for genuine buyers. Due to the bot activity genuine purchasers are left with a limited supply and the risk of their transactions being frontrun due to the slippage which is sometimes applied to secure tokens.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Utilizing the Proof of Existence solution by allowing only PoE holders to participate in a launch or sale will tackle any unwanted bots from attempting to purchase any of the assets

**Use Case 7: Human only communications/social media**

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

As the defi space builds out integrations are on the rise including social medial integrations with a bigger drive for decentralised options. Social media dApps like ‘[Blockscan](https://chat.blockscan.com/start)’ and [ETHmail](https://ethmail.cc) are both functional social media tools which can be used in combination of your wallet to send emails on-chain. We all understand anyone can spin up multiple email addresses off-chain without any KYC verification with little trust on who maybe the author of those social media communications. As these social media integrations build up there will be a bigger demand to understand and verify who is associated to the wallet and the social media activity. The social profiles and integrations can only scale with confidence which is lacking due to the anonymous nature of blockchain.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Either integrating verification on the PoE token or using the planned Proof of Existence Passport dashboard to verify wallets social media profiles can be verified to at least a verified wallet. A GDAO solution will be available to verify any wallet on a global dashboard which will be build out an on-chain presence.

**Use Case 8:** anon/on-chain identity/reputation

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

As blockchain integrations build out the larger the reach and scale grows across platforms. Over time building up an on-chain reputation will play a key part in a profile across the blockchain in several ways including building financial defi scoring based on financial decisions and loans etc. These metrics could contribute to building up a status on-chain tied into one wallet and the KYC-Free enrollment establishing a trust profile related to one person one wallet

**Mitigation Strategy**

Just owning a Proof of Existence (PoE) token will build out your presence on-chain in the GDAO eco system with a number of planned integrations.

**Use Case 9:** gars wars

**Problem explanation / Challenge**

Gas wars typically the outcome of a mass in flood of frontrunning bots attempting to take the lead on purchasing NFT's and tokens by elevating the gas price higher than practical for most people taking part in the sale. The high gas configuration in combination of the many bots pushing the gas demands up results in innocent participants paying excessive gas for sometimes a low cost NFT mint or for a small allocation of a token sale.

**Mitigation Strategy**

Gas wars minimized by utilizing the PoE integrations into planned launches or sales
