# Passport Portal / PoE Dispenser

Passport Portal & PoE dispenser

[Passport Portal - Governor DAO](https://passport.governordao.org)

The passport page is the latest deployment from GDAO which provides the start of central app where statistics and information can be displayed to the community.

The page is sectioned into several panels which provide several different offerings.

Simple summary of the following

**Your PoE VIP Status**

* Status of connected wallet: ‘Connected: wallet address’
* Chain the wallet is connected to: Ethereum Mainnet
* Your biometric wallet status: unenrolled/enrolled
* Status of your PoE token.

**PoE holder only Section**

The section is expanded on detection of a PoE token. The section is currently working progress providing GDAO/xGDAO holdings & when the person enrolled as a VIP with a plan to build out additional on-chain statistics in the future.

**Proof of Existence Statistics**

Details statistics on biometric VIP enrolments & PoE mints historically. In the future further on-chain statistics will be reported.

**Proof of Existence Verifier**

Any on-chain wallet can be verified by entering a wallet address which will report on the status of that wallet holding a PoE token. The following information will be presented.

* Status if wallet has a PoE Token
* If the wallet has enrolled as a VIP through the biometric enrol.
* Holds GDAO or xGDAO

**Proof of Existence Token Claim Portal**

Once enrolled through the VIP portal a PoE token can be minted here. Every 4 hours a batch process runs which collects new VIP enrollments and updates the smart contract on-chain which will authorize any new enrollments to mint a PoE token. The interval of the batch job can be changed at any time with 4 hours being practical currently.

When authorized to mint a PoE token a button will appear which will allow a mint of the PoE token to be actioned with a gas fee to complete the transaction. GDAO has no control on the prices of gas therefore we recommend checking before minting to mininise purchasing when gas is high. Gas can be checked here [https://ethgasstation.info/](https://ethgasstation.info)

Currently GDAO is not charging for the PoE token, the only cost is the gas to mint. In the future there are plans to charge for the PoE token with a percentage sent to the vault. The price of the PoE token will be decided on by the community who can vote on an agreed sustainable fee.
