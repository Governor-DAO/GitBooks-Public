# Creating LP & stake in Geyser Fountain Pool

\
**Summary**

Following assists with creating LP \[Liquidity Provider] for staking in Geyser or on Uniswap.

**Prerequisites**

·         ETH

·         GDAO

·         ETH for conversion and staking

**How Uniswap Liquidity Pool works**

We will go further to explain how the Uniswap Liquidity pool works. The liquidity pools are an aggregation of tokens in smart contracts. There are many ERC-20 tokens in this liquidity pool for you to exchange – swap, send, and Pool- with another person, With Ethereum being the conduit. So, you can create a new exchange pair in a new liquidity pool for any token of your choice.

For example, you can be part of the ETH/GDAO liquidity pool. You will need to make an equal value of Ethereum and GDAO, which is the token that you want to participate with. Therefore when someone comes in and decides to trade ETH/GDAO on Uniswap, your liquidity will be taped.

If someone wants to trade Ethereum in exchange for GDAO, your GDAO liquidity might reduce while Ethereum liquidity goes up. If your GDAO goes down by a dollar, your Ethereum will go up by a dollar also. This is the way that the Uniswap Liquidity Pool work.

To provide LP one must contribute an equal split of two tokens 50/50 of each to form the LP.
